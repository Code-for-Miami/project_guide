# Project Guide
Guides to creating, managing and scaling open source projects at Code For Miami.

A manifest of guides and resources we need to create. As we are just getting started everything here is open to debate.
I believe projects need to be broken down into a idea phase, start phase, building phase, and dead phase.

If you would like to contribute feel free to open a pull request or github issue to discuss various line items if one does not exist already, when you do please a make pr on this readme and link to the issue discussion.

**Goal**
- Reduce frustrations for users and contributers
- Be inviting to new projects and leads
- Prioritise small tasks for "Quick wins."
- Remove [@cyberstrike](https://github.com/CyberStrike) as a bottle-neck to getting things done.

```
From the perspective of a user,
if a feature is not documented, it does not exist.
If a feature is documented incorrectly, then it is broken.
- WriteTheDocs
```


## Ideas
The birthplace of many past and future Code For Miami Projects
this is the place to start if you have a new idea or looking to propose something.

## New Projects
Guides to creating projects at code for miami.

[New Projects Task List](https://github.com/Code-for-Miami/project_guide/issues/2)

A checklist that covers all the steps to creating a new project which will essentially translate to 
a guide for every step.

1. Announce your project
   - Announce your starting your new project on the #projects channel.
2. Name your project
3. Create a Github Repo // Fork from Project Template
4. [Configuring Your Repo](/docs/configuring_your_repo.md)

    A guide on recommended changes to repository settings in order to facilitate smooth collaboration and management.
    
    - [Protect Your Master](/docs/configuring_your_repo.md#protect-master)
    - [Squash It Up - Open Issue](https://github.com/Code-for-Miami/project_guide/issues/7)
      
      The what, why, how and caveats about squash only merge strategy for your master branch.

5. [Create A landing page template](https://github.com/Code-for-Miami/project-landing-page-template)
6. Update Readme with required information
7. Gather and Document Requirements
8. Pick a stack

# Legacy
 
Stolen from Open Austins Docs. Code For America used to have a project stage guideline but it seems to be now defunct. Currently hunting it down for ideas.

### Start an **Experiment**

The **experiment** stage is all about exploring problems/ideas.

Open Austin uses [Code for America's four project stages](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages).

- [Experiment](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages#experiment)
- [Alpha](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages#alpha)
- [Beta](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages#beta)
- [Official](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages#official)

### Start an **Experiment**

The **experiment** stage is all about exploring problems/ideas. Open Austin should have plenty of projects at the experiment stage. Most projects will end at this stage, and that's okay.

1. Do something and tell us about it. Open an issue at https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues and tag it with experiment.
2. Tell us if you need any resources to get started (AWS hosting, Cartodb, mockup tools, etc.)
3. Come to an [Open Austin event](/events) and work on share your project

### Experiment to **Alpha**

The **alpha** stage is about making sure your project solves a person's/group's problem.

:information_source:  This is the point at which a project becomes an "approved" Open Austin project.

1. Identify a project's owner(s)
2. Get approval from an Open Austin coreteam member
3. Explain
  - What problem the project tries to solve
  - Who the users are
4. List the project on [open-austin.org/projects](https://open-austin.org/projects) [link to how-to](https://github.com/open-austin/open-austin.github.io/wiki/How-to-Add-a-Project-Page)
5. Go through a code/architecture review
  - What is the architecture of your project? _We may ask you to make changes to the architecture._
  - How do you deploy the project?

### Alpha to **Beta**
 
The **beta** stage is about getting "more users" and "more feedback." The project should be looking for more users and recording more metrics.

1. You should look for government or community partners, if applicable
2. Start polishing the app
3. Have a sense of what metrics you'll be recording and using to measure impact
4. Plan some launch event

### Beta to **Official**

A project becomes **official** when it's polished, well known, has a community partner, and the project leaders have a good sense of the impact of the project. 

1. Have a launch event! Congratulations, you've done an awesome job, and now it's time to enjoy your work.
2. Have your metrics for usage and impact readily available.
