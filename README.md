# Project Guide
Guides to creating, managing and scaling open source projects at Code For Miami

A manifest of guides and resources we need to create. As we are just getting started everything here is open to debate.
I believe projects need to be broken down into a idea phase, start phase, building phase, and dead phase.

If feel free to open a pull request or github issue to discuss various line items if one does not exist already, when you do please a make pr on this readme and link to the issue discussion.

## Growth and Maintenance


## Dead Phase

- What is the definition of a dead project
- What to do when your project is dead

## Legacy
 
Stolen from Open Austins Docs. Code For America used to have a project stage guideline but it seems to be now defunct. Currently hunting it down for ideas.

## Project stages

[Code for America's four project stages](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages).

- [Experiment](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages#experiment)
- [Alpha](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages#alpha)
- [Beta](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages#beta)
- [Official](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages#official)

### Start an **Experiment**

The **experiment** stage is all about exploring problems/ideas. Code For Miami ## Project stages

Open Austin uses [Code for America's four project stages](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages).

- [Experiment](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages#experiment)
- [Alpha](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages#alpha)
- [Beta](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages#beta)
- [Official](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects/stages#official)

### Start an **Experiment**

The **experiment** stage is all about exploring problems/ideas. Open Austin should have plenty of projects at the experiment stage. Most projects will end at this stage, and that's okay.

1. Do something and tell us about it. Open an issue at https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues and tag it with experiment.
2. Tell us if you need any resources to get started (AWS hosting, Cartodb, mockup tools, etc.)
3. Come to an [Open Austin event](/events) and work on share your project

### Experiment to **Alpha**

The **alpha** stage is about making sure your project solves a person's/group's problem.

:information_source:  This is the point at which a project becomes an "approved" Open Austin project.

1. Identify a project's owner(s)
2. Get approval from an Open Austin coreteam member
3. Explain
  - What problem the project tries to solve
  - Who the users are
4. List the project on [open-austin.org/projects](https://open-austin.org/projects) [link to how-to](https://github.com/open-austin/open-austin.github.io/wiki/How-to-Add-a-Project-Page)
5. Go through a code/architecture review
  - What is the architecture of your project? _We may ask you to make changes to the architecture._
  - How do you deploy the project?

### Alpha to **Beta**
 
The **beta** stage is about getting "more users" and "more feedback." The project should be looking for more users and recording more metrics.

1. You should look for government or community partners, if applicable
2. Start polishing the app
3. Have a sense of what metrics you'll be recording and using to measure impact
4. Plan some launch event

### Beta to **Official**

A project becomes **official** when it's polished, well known, has a community partner, and the project leaders have a good sense of the impact of the project. 

1. Have a launch event! Congratulations, you've done an awesome job, and now it's time to enjoy your work.
2. Have your metrics for usage and impact readily available.
